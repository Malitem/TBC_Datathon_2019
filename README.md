# TBC_Datathon_2019

This was a weekend-long competition organized by TBC bank in Georgia. Here we were challenged to work on a customer loyalty evaluation program. We had to feature engineer the given data using hot encoding methods, create new features out of the existing ones keeping in mind the column vs row ratio, understand which features affect the customer loyalty most so that we could train our model based on them.
